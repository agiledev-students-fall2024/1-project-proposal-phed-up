# Project Proposal

## Bite Buddy

### What and why?

<strong>Problem Statement</strong>: Nowadays, many users rely on multiple food delivery services (such as UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and Postmates) to order meals. However, managing these services can be frustrating and inefficient. Users are forced to switch between apps to compare prices, delivery times, and fees. Tracking orders across platforms is cumbersome, and there is no system to save favorite meals or apply promo codes across services. Oftentimes, this results in missed discounts, higher costs or even just fatigue, which can be mitigated by having a centralized food ordering platform.

Thus, the challenge is to create a mobile web application that can include different food delivery options, helps users compare prices, track orders, and save on delivery fees. Optimally, it will also offer personalized recommendations based on their preferences and order history. The app aims to enhance convenience, streamline the decision-making process, and improve the overall food delivery experience.

### For whom?

The app will primarily be designed for the mass consumer who regularly orders meals from food delivery platforms. More specifically, it will be targeting those who are more budget-conscious and want to save money on delivery fees and take advantage of any discounts, promotions, and loyalty rewards.

### How?

Features:

1. Order Management: Connect and sync  accounts from various food delivery services (like UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub) in one place. View and manage all orders in a single interface, eliminating the need to switch between different apps.

2. Real-Time Tracking: Track the status of  food deliveries in real-time, no matter which platform is used to place orders.

3. Price and Delivery Comparison: When searching for restaurants or specific dishes, easily compare prices, delivery fees, and estimated delivery times across all connected services. Choose the best option that fits budget and timing needs.

4. Favorite Meals and Quick Reordering: Save favorite meals and restaurants for quick access. Reorder past meals with a single click, making it effortless to get favorite dishes without having to search again.

5. Spending Insights: Track and review food delivery spending. View detailed insights into order history, average costs, and spending patterns to better manage budget.

6. Loyalty Rewards Tracking: Manage and monitor loyalty points and rewards across different delivery services. Get notified when eligible for discounts or free deliveries.

### Scope

The proposal can be divided into essential features such as order tracking, and advanced features such as group ordering or personalized recommendations. These features are feasible with the help of existing APIs and technologies which are common in app development, making them realistic for a semester-long project. The different features can also be developed in parallel, which helps to speed up the process. Even with existing APIs this project would not be too easy since it contains many deliverables which can be continuously optimized throughout the semester.
